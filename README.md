## Overview
This repository provides a simple example of deploying a FastAPI application to Cloudflare Workers using `uv`. FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Cloudflare Workers allow you to deploy serverless applications at the edge, providing fast responses to your users.

## Features
- FastAPI integration with Cloudflare Workers.
- Lightweight and efficient deployment.
- Easy to understand and modify.
- Supports asynchronous programming.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Node.js (for building the worker).
- A Cloudflare account.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanTeXxXGame/uv-cloudflare-workers-example.git
   cd uv-cloudflare-workers-example
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

3. Install the necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

## Deployment
To deploy your FastAPI application to Cloudflare Workers, follow these steps:

1. Configure your Cloudflare account:
   - Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.
   - Create a new Worker.

2. Set up your `wrangler.toml` file:
   - Modify the configuration file to match your Cloudflare account settings.

3. Build and publish your Worker:
   ```bash
   wrangler publish
   ```

## Usage
Once deployed, you can access your FastAPI application through the URL provided by Cloudflare Workers. The application can handle requests, and you can expand its functionality by adding more routes.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

You can test this application by sending requests to your Cloudflare Worker URL.
